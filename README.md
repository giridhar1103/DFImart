# DFImart
# Defichain based marketplace for shopping on amazon directly using crypto.

In today's digital age, the convenience of online shopping has become an integral part of our lives. However, utilizing cryptocurrency for e-commerce purchases often presents a complex and challenging experience. DFImart aims to revolutionize this landscape by introducing a seamless and user-friendly marketplace that empowers users to effortlessly purchase products from Amazon using DFI tokens.

DFImart's innovative approach involves strategically curating product data from Amazon and presenting it on our platform. This allows users to browse and select their desired products without navigating Amazon's website. DFImart exclusively accepts DFI tokens as payment.


To facilitate transactions, DFImart maintains a readily available pool of Indian rupees (INR) specifically designated for payments to Amazon. When a user purchases a product using DFI tokens, these tokens are transferred into the company's pool of DFI holdings. Subsequently, the corresponding amount of INR from the pool is utilized to complete the transaction with Amazon.

To ensure a smooth and efficient process, DFImart leverages the capabilities of the Defichain blockchain and collaborates with a trusted Indian exchange to maintain adequate liquidity in INR. Additionally, a small transaction fee is charged to cover on-chain swapping costs and serves as the primary revenue stream for the platform.

With its user-focused and user-friendly approach, DFImart is poised to revolutionize the way people shop online using cryptocurrency. By simplifying the transaction process, expanding product offerings, and maintaining transparency, DFImart envisions becoming the go-to marketplace for crypto enthusiasts seeking a seamless and secure e-commerce experience.
